# ShareOn - Easy File Sharing
Simple file sharing web application in which you can drag-n-drop files to share them with your friends.

It also uses [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) Mail Client for sending out emails!

This is the client-side part of the whole application. If you want to see the Backend, then please visit [here](https://github.com/harshit-sharma-gits/file-sharing-app-api/)

### Usage
